# ml-mushrooms-data-classifiers
This project implements KNN & Decision Tree classifiers to learn a dataset of mushroom's charectrestics.

- TwoLevelDecisionTree.py
Python code which builds a two level decision tree using a multi class data set.

- KthNeighbourClassifier.py
Python code which finds out the best value of K for a given dataset using the KNN classifier. 

- MushroomsDistribution.py 
Python code which prints out the distribution for mushroom classes

- MushroomDecisionTreeClassifier.py 
Python code which builds a classifier for Mushrooms data using Decision Tree

- MushroomKNNClassifier.py 
Python code which builds a cClassifier for Mushrooms data using KNN

# Model Performance Of Decision Tree Classifier
Accuracy score is 1.0
Recall score is 1.0
Precision store is 1.0
F1 score is 1.0

# Model Performance Of KNN Classifier
Average Model Score is 0.9992613111026903 for 5-fold
 
# Comparision of Models
For a 5Fold cross validation both models provider nearly similar results with KNN Decision Tree being more close to 100% classification
